    <p>
        The OxCOVID19 Database is on a firmer footing today, with the award of funding from UKRI to maintain and expand our database and to promote our work. As well as improving our day-to-day operations, this support means we'll be able to invest in the infrastructure needed to preserve the database in the long term.

        Scientific Reports have published our paper <em>OxCOVID19 Database, a multimodal data repository for better understanding the global impact of COVID-19</em>. This paper describes the structure of the database, its potential uses, and the challenges we faced along the way. It's open access, so you can have a read on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-88481-4">Scientific Reports</a>.

    We&nbsp;are&nbsp;delighted to introduce our interactive
    <a href="tracker.html">Oxford University COVID-19 Tracker (OxCOVID-19 Tracker)</a>.
    The Tracker provides a clear way to view the geographic spread of the global pandemic as well
    as a more detailed view of the UK. See how your local situation compares to that of neighboring
    areas and how different parts of the world are experiencing the pandemic.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can choose to view the cumulative impact by selecting the total number of cases to date or
    to see the current state of the epidemic by selecting the average daily numbers over the last seven days.
    By keeping the 'per 100,000 population' box checked, see the rate of cases adjusted
    for the population of the local authority or country.
  </p>

  <p>
    Click on an area to see a graph of how COVID-19 has developed over time in that location or use the slider
    at the top to see a snapshot of the pandemic at any time in the past.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Tracker draws on epidemiology and administrative data from
     University of Oxford <a href="https://covid19.eng.ox.ac.uk/database.html"> OxCOVID19 Database</a>.
